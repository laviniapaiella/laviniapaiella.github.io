My current research focuses on studying the possible mechanisms supporting the formation and growth of intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) within star clusters. These black holes have masses between hundreds and millions solar masses and may represent valuable probes of the potential pathways leading to supermassive black hole formation. Though we have growing evidence of them in very diverse stellar systems there is no clear observational smoking gun which can distinguish their effects from other types of objects. Hence, we try to investigate their formation and growth through numerical simulations. Most N-body and Monte Carlo simulations cannot tackle the extreme regimes in which IMBHs are formed, thus recent studies on the assembly of these objects in star clusters also rely on the use of semi-analytic population codes. Im currently using and developing a dynamical semi-analytic code called B-POP, check out the latest publication on the code [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.520.5259A/abstract)!

<!-- My current research focuses on the study of the very first stars formed in the Universe (Population III stars), their capablity of producing gamma ray burst (GRBs) and of providing heavy black hole seeds for the production of supermassive black holes. 

Specifically, my PhD project aims at tackling these questions:

* How are Pop-III GRBs different with respect to the ones observed at low
redshifts?
* How can we model the jet propagation within a Pop-III star? What stellar
properties affect the jet propagation the most?
* What is the expected rate of production of Pop-III GRBs?
* How many of them can be detected by present and future X-ray telescopes?
How would they appear in our instruments?
* Can we infer properties of the initial population and of the environment
in which Pop-III stars interact from the observed GRB rate? -->

My past research focused on constraining properties of nuclear interactions in neutron stars from the multimessenger emission of binary neutron star mergers. If you want to know more about these topics, [here](/files/Tesi_Magistrale_Paiella.pdf) you can find my master thesis work for which I was awarded the 2022 Milla Baldo Ceolin national prize by INFN.
