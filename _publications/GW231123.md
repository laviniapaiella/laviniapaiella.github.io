In this paper, we explore the dynamical formation of GW231123-like events in different cluster environments using the B-POP code, exploring how stellar mergers in primordial binaries and hierarchical mergers contribute to the assembly of these ligh IMBH binaries. We investigate different metallicities and spin prescriptions for the remnants of the stellar mergers and estimate the rate of these events for Milky-way like and dwarf galaxies.
